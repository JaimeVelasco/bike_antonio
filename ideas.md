#We are GroupSet SA

#What are we:
We are a portal for bike commuters to interact with their local government.

#Componets
+On mobile, drop a pin. Road hazards, etc. Saves your pin in a profile.
+When you get home, we can spin up an email with the correct city representative or whoever, based on region.
+Email template. No craziness.
+Perhaps a filter; sanitation dept?


For commuters, would also have a resource page. Maybe that is where the email button lives? Map can also be filtered for people commuting.

#Questions going forward:
+Can people view others pins?
+Do we want to have a way to stack hazards? (i.e. 3 other people have reported this pothole.)
